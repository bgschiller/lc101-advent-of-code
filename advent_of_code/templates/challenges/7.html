<p>
  Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
  </li>
  <li>
    The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
  </li>
  <li>
    So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, <code>stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Write a function that takes <code>stock_prices_yesterday</code> and returns a string instructing how to obtain the best profit possible from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>
  stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
# returns "buying for $5 at 9:32 and selling for $11 at 9:34 makes $6"
</pre>
<p>
No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
</p>
<p>
  When you're ready, run your code against the following
